<p class="stage_description" id="cell_description"> This is the first stage from the game, you arrive from a metiore and now you are part of this planet ecosystem, as a tiny cell. Here you will need to eat so earn DNA points and grow to evolve. In the beggining of the game you can chose to be a vegetarian species or a carnivorous species, if you are a carnivorouos you need to use your creature to kill others and eat their meat. If you are a vegetarian you need to eat plants and survive predadors attacks. You can use the DNA points you earned by eating when you mate with another one of your species, you do this by clicking a button. After you mate a egg is born, and you can edit the creature inside this egg to buy upgrades for example spikes or better locomotion, this will cost you DNA points, so I'ts always good saving it. After you grow enough you can get your legs in the next matting and evolve to the next stage!</p>
